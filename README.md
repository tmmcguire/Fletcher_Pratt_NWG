# Fletcher Pratt Naval Wargame Summary

Summary of the rules for the Fletcher Pratt Naval Wargame.

## SOURCE

This is a summary of a selected part of the rules from
*[Fletcher Pratt's Naval Wargame Wargaming with model ships
1900-1945](http://www.wargaming.co/recreation/details/fpnaval.htm),*
by Fletcher Pratt, edited by John Curry, with inputs from Donald
Featherstone.

John Curry has asked me not to include all of the rules, since the
funding source for the History of Wargaming Project is book revenue.
As a result, this covers ship-to-ship gunnery combat, but should cover
enough of the flavor of the game encourage anyone interested to check
out the book. It's cheap and has many features besides the rules of the
game.

This book is a production of the [History of Wargaming
Project](http://www.wargaming.co/index.htm).
